# Let's talk about some errors you may have:

1.**What do I do when my batter is too thin or too thick?**

  This is a great question. Always try to follow the package's instructions, but sometimes mistakes do happen. Basically what it comes down to is how thick your pancakes will be. If your batter is thick and super lumpy, your pancakes will be thick and may have several spots of dry mix. If your batter is very thin, then your pancakes will be thin.
* **Too Thick:** Add a little bit more water, a tablespoon at a time, until the batter is easier to stir and only has small lumps.
* **Too Thin:** You have three options:
> 1. Add more mix
2. Use the batter like it is
3. Scrap the whole thing and try again.

I recommend the second option because having thin batter is not that big of a deal. The pancakes still taste like pancakes. However, its your decision what to do.

2.**What do I do when I flip the pancakes over too early or too late?**

3.**What do I do when my pancakes stick to the pan?**
