# Let's talk about some errors you may have:

1.**What do I do when my batter is too thin or too thick?**

  ---
  This is a great question. Always try to follow the package's instructions, but sometimes mistakes do happen. Basically what it comes down to is how thick your pancakes will be. If your batter is thick and super lumpy, your pancakes will be thick and may have several spots of dry mix. If your batter is very thin, then your pancakes will be thin.
* **Too Thick:** Add a little bit more water, a tablespoon at a time, until the batter is easier to stir and only has small lumps.
* **Too Thin:** You have three options:

> 1. Add more mix
2. Use the batter like it is
3. Scrap the whole thing and try again.

I recommend the second option because having thin batter is not that big of a deal. The pancakes still taste like pancakes. However, its your decision what to do.

2.**What do I do when I flip the pancakes over too early or too late?**

  ---
  * **Too Early:** If you flip it over and find that the cooked side is too light, simply flip it back over once that side has finished cooking. You can flip it back and forth as many times as you need.
  * **Too Late:** If you burn your pancake, you'll either have to eat it or scrap it. Hopefully, it is just darker than you wanted but still edible. With time and practice you'll learn when the right time is to flip pancakes over.

3.**What do I do when my pancakes stick to the pan?**

  ---
  My advice to you is to always spray the pan with more non-stick spray after removing the pancakes, especially if you are using batter with chocolate chips or blueberries. If your pancake gets stuck, just scrape it off as best as you can.
