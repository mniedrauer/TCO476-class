# Let's talk about some errors you may have:

1.**What do I about my batter being too thin, or too thick?**

  ---
  This is a common question. Always try to follow the package instructions, but sometimes mistakes do happen. Basically, it comes down to is how thick your pancakes will be. If your batter is viscous and super lumpy, your pancakes will be thick, and may have several spots of dry mix. If your batter is very watery, then your pancakes will be thin.
  
* **Too Thick:** Add a little bit more water, a tablespoon at a time, until the batter is easier to stir and only has small lumps.
* **Too Thin:** You have three options:

>1. Add more mix
2. Use the batter like it is
3. Scrap the whole thing, and try again

I recommend the second option because having thin batter is not that big of a deal. The pancakes still taste like pancakes. However, it's your decision what to do.

2.**What do I do when I flip the pancakes over too early, or too late?**

  ---
  * **Too Early:** If you flip it over and find that the cooked side is too light, simply flip it back over once that side has finished cooking. You can flip it back and forth as many times as you need.
  * **Too Late:** If you burn your pancake, you'll either have to eat it, or scrap it. Hopefully, it is just darker than you wanted but still edible. With time and practice you'll learn when the right time is to flip pancakes over.

3.**What do I do when my pancakes stick to the pan?**

  ---
  My advice is to always spray the pan with more non-stick spray after removing the pancakes; especially if you are using batter with chocolate chips, or blueberries. If your pancake gets stuck, just scrape it off as best as you can.

4.**What is a good way to clean up burned-n pancakes?**

  ---
  Fill the pan with about 2 - 3 inches of water. Add 1/4 cup of baking soda. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to simmer rapidly for 15 minutes. After a half hour, wash the pot or pan as usual, gently scrubbing. If the burnt residue is stubborn, simply repeat the process.
