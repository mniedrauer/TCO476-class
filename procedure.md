# Let's Make Pancakes!

1. First, set your pan or griddle on the stove top and spray with non-stick cooking spray.

2. Now turn on the stove. Your package instructions may tell you a specific temperature (for example, mine said 375 degrees), which isn't helpful when the dial displays single-digit numbers. The picture below shows approximately where you should set the dial on your stove.

3. While the pan is heating up, make the pancake batter by combining the mix and water as required by the package directions. The batter should be slightly lumpy when you are finished mixing.

4. Once the pan is hot, pour a small amount of the batter onto the pan. Luckily, my bowl had a lip that allowed me to use it to pour the batter. However, if yours does not, you can use a small measuring cup or something similiar; it really is up to you how you choose to pour the batter.

5. Wait a few minutes before flipping the pancake(s) over. This process is one that you will have to learn for yourself. The best way to describe how you know the pancake is ready is the edges will look almost plastic-y.

6. Flip over the pancakes and let the other side cook for a couple minutes (this side is usually shorter). Feel free to flip the pancake back over if you think it needs to cook longer.

7. Continue this process until all your batter is gone. Ta-dah!
