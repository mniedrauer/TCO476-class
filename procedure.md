# Let's Begin Making Pancakes

1. First, set your pan or griddle on the stove top and spray with non-stick cooking spray.

2. Now turn on the stove. Your package instructions may tell you a specific temperature (for example, mine said 375 degrees), which isn't helpful when the dial displays single-digit numbers. The picture below shows approximately where you should set the dial on your stove.

3. While the pan is heating up, make the pancake batter by combining the mix and water as required by the package directions. The batter should be slightly lumpy when you are finished mixing.
